## Theming

A new hook, `useTheme()`, should now be used to get the theme object. This
change was necessary to allow swapping the theme on the fly.

Importing the `colors`, `theme`, `themeDark`, or `brand` objects still works but is deprecated.

## AppView

`AppView` is deprecated. The layout is now provided by `Main`, and `Header`
should be used to provide the top bar of an app.

To keep using the `AppView` component, set `layout={false}` on `Main`.

## Button

The `secondary` mode doesnâ€™t exist anymore. Setting it will display the button in normal mode (the default).

## Springs

The `spring()` function has been removed. The `springs` object should be used instead.

## Viewport breakpoints

small: 540 => 52 GU
medium: 768 => 96 GU
large: 1170 => 138 GU

## BreakPoint has been removed

The ViewPort component should be used instead.

## GRID / grid() have been removed

The Layout component should be used instead.

## AragonApp has been removed

The Main component should be used instead.

## AppView

AppView is now a simpler component, setting the background and the layout (using the Layout component).

The `title`, `padding`, `height`, `appBar`, and `tabs` props are now ignored.

## AppBar is deprecated

A combination of Header and Bar should be used instead.

## TabBar

Support for the `onSelect` prop has been removed. Please use `onChange` instead.
